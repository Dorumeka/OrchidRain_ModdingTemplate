# OrchidRain_ModdingTemplate
Project meant to help getting started with making mods for Orchid Rain. Includes examples from the modding guides.
If you're not interested in the examples, and want a clean project, you can delete the "Examples" and "UMS_LODs" folders, and the contents of the "StreamingAssets" folder.
