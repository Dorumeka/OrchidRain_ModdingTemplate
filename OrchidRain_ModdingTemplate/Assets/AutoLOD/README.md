# AutoLOD
Automatic LOD generation + scene optimization - Initial release was on January 12, 2018 via [blogpost](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/01/12/unity-labs-autolod-experimenting-with-automatic-performance-improvements/)

AutoLOD is primarily a framework for enabling automatic post-processing of geometrical model assets on import. A [default mesh simplifier](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityMeshSimplifier/) is included, but can be swapped out with other simplifiers and on a per-model basis if needed. Additionally, a whole scene can be hierarchically chunked in LODs with [SceneLOD](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/AutoLOD/wiki/Scenelod).

## Experimental Status
It’s important to note that AutoLOD is an experimental feature. As such, there is no formal support (e.g. FogBugz, support@unity3d.com, Premium Support, etc.) offered, so please do not use these channels. Instead, post your questions, comments, suggestions, and issues here on GitHub.

**As with anything experimental/preview/alpha/beta, it is always a good idea to make a backup of your project before using.**

Experimental means this:
- Namespaces, classes, software architecture, prefabs, etc. can change at any point. If you are writing your own tools, then you might need to update them as these things change.
- There won’t always be an upgrade path from one release to the next, so you might need to fix things manually, which leads to the next point...
- Stuff can and will break (!)
- There’s **no guarantee** that this project will move out of experimental status within any specific timeframe.
- As such, there is no guarantee that this will remain an actively supported project.

## Features
- LOD generation on model import with sensible [defaults](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/AutoLOD/wiki/Home)
- Project-wide and per-model LOD import settings
- Asynchronous, pluggable LOD generation framework
- Hierarchical LOD support via [SceneLOD](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/AutoLOD/wiki/Scenelod)

### Useful classes (for your own projects, too!)
- [MonoBehaviourHelper](Scripts/Helpers/MonoBehaviourHelper.cs) - a way to run coroutines in the editor + main thread execution from worker threads
- [LODGroupExtensions](Scripts/Extensions/LODGroupExtensions.cs) - useful extension methods (e.g. GetCurrentLOD)
- [TimedEnumerator](Scripts/Helpers/TimedEnumerator.cs) -  a way to control maximum execution time of coroutines
- [TextureAtlasModule](Scripts/Editor/TextureAtlasModule.cs) - automatically generate texture atlases
- [WorkingMesh](Scripts/Helpers/WorkingMesh.cs) - a thread-safe mesh (_and now job-friendly!_) struct

## Evaluating
Unity 2018.1 or a later version is required

### Git Dependencies
- [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
- [git-submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)

### Cloning
1. Create a new Unity project or use an existing one
2. From the command line change directory to your project's `Assets` directory.
3. Run `git lfs clone --recursive https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/AutoLOD`

### Updating
Because this project uses [git-submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule), you'll need to execute `git submodule update` after pulling whenever a submodule is updated. You could execute this command always just to be safe or if you notice that a submodule is showing as modified after pulling changes.

Optionally, you could add a [git hook for post-checkout](https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/keeping-git-submodules-in-sync-with-your-branches/) or use a GUI (e.g. SourceTree) that does this automatically for you.

### Project Settings
If you plan on making changes to AutoLOD and/or contributing back, then you'll need to set the `Asset Serialization` property under Edit->Project Settings->Editor to `Force Text`.
